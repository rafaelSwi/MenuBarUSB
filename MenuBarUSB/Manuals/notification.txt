The system employs a structured notification mechanism to inform the user when USB devices are connected or disconnected. This process is tightly integrated with the I/O Registry’s event-based callbacks. When the operating system registers a device match event for a USB class, a connection callback is invoked. Conversely, when a device is terminated in the registry, a disconnection callback is triggered. Each callback receives an iterator containing all affected registry entries, which are then translated into internal device objects using the same property-extraction logic applied during enumeration.

Before issuing any user-visible notification, the software performs a cooldown validation step. This mechanism is designed to prevent excessive or redundant alerts in situations where multiple USB events occur in rapid succession, such as when hubs enumerate several child devices or when the system undergoes transient I/O reconfiguration. The cooldown timer stores the timestamp of the last dispatched notification and suppresses new notifications if the elapsed time since the previous event is below a configured threshold.

If the cooldown condition is satisfied, the system composes a notification payload containing device names, vendor identifiers, or other descriptive attributes, and dispatches it through the platform’s user-notification framework. This ensures that the user receives timely but non-intrusive feedback regarding hardware changes. The result is a controlled and predictable event-notification flow that avoids overwhelming the user while still providing clear and accurate information about USB connection and disconnection events.
